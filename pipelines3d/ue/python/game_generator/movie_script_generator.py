INT. TESLAâ€™S LAB - NIGHT

Nikola Tesla is working on his latest invention, an electric motor. He is surrounded by tools and equipment, and her has a thick stack of papers next to him. He is muttering to himself as he works.

TESLA:
Just a few more adjustments...

He makes a final adjustment to the motor, then steps back and admires his work.

TESLA:
There. It's perfect.

He picks up a piece of paper and starts to write down his latest findings. Suddenly, the door to the lab opens and Thomas Edison walks in.

EDISON:
Tesla! I've been looking all over for you.

TESLA:
Edison. What are you doing here?

EDISON:
I heard you were working on an electric motor. I wanted to see it for myself.

Tesla hesitates for a moment, then nods and leads Edison over to the motor.

TESLA:
Here it is.

Edison looks at the motor, then shakes his head.

EDISON:
It's not going to work, Tesla. You're wasting your time.

Tesla bristles at Edison's words.

TESLA:
I'll show you.

He activates the motor, and it starts humming smoothly.

EDISON:
Impressive.

TESLA:
Thank you.

EDISON:
You know, Tesla, I've been thinking... maybe we could work together. What do you say?

Tesla considered Edison's offer for a moment, then shakes his head.

TESLA:
No, thank you. I prefer to work alone.

EDISON:
Suit yourself. But I think you're making a mistake.

Tesla doesn't respond as Edison walks out of the lab. He looks back at his invention, a satisfied smile on his face.
